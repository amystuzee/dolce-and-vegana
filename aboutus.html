      <p> We've been working on the Code First: Girls beginner course this term, and this is our final project for the course competition! Read below to find out a little more about the creators and why we chose this website idea. </p>

          <td>Hi, Iâ€™m Olivia Neil-Jones. I study Classics at  Gonville & Caius (University of Cambridge) and decided to give coding a try by applying to a CodeFirst: Girls introductory course - this website is the result. I am not a vegan, but I am a foodie. I relish (pun intended) having new gastronomic experiences, especially in my own kitchen. I was very intrigued to explore this new area via this exciting project.</td>

          <td> Hi! I'm Amy and I'm a Natural Scientist at Newnham, currently in my final year specialising in Pharmacology. I first made the change to a vegan diet in 2014, and though I've had a few stumbles along the way (and still hate tofu...) I've embraced the vegan diet and lifestyle at uni. I'm not big on raw veg and my cupboard's stuffed with bourbon biscuits (yup, vegan!), so branching out to vegan puddings was only natural... I hope you enjoy our website and, if nothing else, it gets you thinking about veganism and trying something different in the kitchen.</td>
